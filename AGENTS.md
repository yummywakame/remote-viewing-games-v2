# MindSight Training — Project Documentation for AI Agents

## What This App Is

**mindsight.training** is a solo practice web app for developing MindSight — the ability to perceive visual information while blindfolded (extra-ocular vision). Users practice independently through interactive games that train color and shape perception without using their eyes.

This is a companion app to the coaching site at **mindsight.coach**. Where mindsight.coach is for booking 1-on-1 sessions with Olivia Meiring, this app is for ongoing solo practice between sessions (and for self-guided learners).

## What MindSight Is — Domain Knowledge

**MindSight** (also: extra-ocular vision / EOV, blindfold vision, sight without eyes, eyeless sight, closed-eye vision, PSI vision, extravision) is the trained ability to perceive visual information without using the physical eyes. Key facts:

- A natural human capacity available to everyone — sighted or blind, adult or child
- Trainable through practice; linked to neuroplasticity, focused attention, and the pineal gland
- Not a trick, not magic — genuine perception through non-ocular pathways
- **Not** Dr. Dan Siegel's "mindsight" (an emotional intelligence concept — completely unrelated)

**Well-known teacher for reference:** Dalia Burgoin — daliaburgoin.com

## About the App

The app provides solo practice games for MindSight development. All games are **stateless** — no user accounts, no saved progress.

| Game | Route | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Color Game | `/color-game` | Live |
| Shape Game | `/shape-game` | Live |
| Number Game | `/number-game` | Planned |
| Object Game | `/object-game` | Planned |
| Word Game | `/word-game` | Planned |
| Scene Game | `/scene-game` | Planned |

Each game is designed to be used with a physical blindfold or sleep mask. The user puts on the blindfold, then attempts to perceive what is shown on screen through MindSight. The app provides feedback and progression.

**Voice features** — Audio interaction support is available (see `VOICE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`).

## Development

```bash
npm run dev     # Start dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build   # Production build
npm run start   # Run production server
npm run lint    # Lint
```

**Key conventions:**
- App Router only — all routes live under `src/app/`
- Tailwind for all styling — avoid inline styles and CSS modules
- Radix UI primitives in `src/components/ui/` — use these as the base for new interactive components
- CVA (`class-variance-authority`) for component variant patterns
- Framer Motion for any animations beyond Tailwind's built-ins
- `isomorphic-dompurify` is present — use it whenever rendering any user-supplied or external HTML

## Deployment

Currently on Vercel. When the `mindsight.training` domain is connected, update:
- The Vercel project's custom domain setting
- `src/app/metadata.js` — update `metadataBase` URL and any hardcoded domain references
